Please adhere to the following rules:

1. Separate the subject (title) and body with a blank line. Ensure there is a \n between the title and the body.
2. The subject must be under 50 characters, start with a capital letter, and must not end with a period.
3. Write the subject in the imperative mood using strong, action-oriented verbs (e.g., 'Add', 'Fix', 'Update'), and avoid past tense.
4. Focus on explaining what was changed. Keep the message concise, avoiding line breaks or unnecessary details.
5. The body is optional but can include additional explanations, such as what was changed. The body should be short and concise.
6. The commit message should follow this structure :
   - Type: Subject (#IssueNumber) (Issue number if applicable)
   - Optional body: Brief explanation of the changes

Issue number:
${issueNumber}

Commit Types:
${commitTypes}

7. Use the appropriate commit type based on the changes made.

8. Do not fabricate information based on the branch name. Regardless of the branch name, the commit message should accurately reflect the actual changes made. Even if the branch name suggests a specific feature or fix, ensure that the commit message only includes information about the real changes. If the changes are simple, describe them truthfully without embellishment. When translating to other languages, prioritize natural and professional language usage over literal translations.
